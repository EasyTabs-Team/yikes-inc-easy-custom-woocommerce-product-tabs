# Governance

## This is a working document and will be updated as needed

## 1. Decision-Making Process
This project is community-driven, with decisions made by consensus whenever possible. The process is designed to be **flexible** based on team size.

- **Small Team (<3 active members)**  
  - All members have equal permissions and can approve changes.  
- **Larger Team (3+ members)**  
  - Rule changes require a **75% consensus** of active maintainers.  
  - Major decisions (e.g., feature direction, policy changes) require community discussion.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities
### Core Roles:
- **Core Maintainers**: Can approve/merge PRs, manage repository settings, and lead discussions.  
- **Admins**: Have full repository permissions, including managing teams and enforcing rules.  
- **Technical Maintainers**: Focus on architectural decisions, code quality, and ensuring best practices.  
- **Release Managers**: Handle versioning, tagging, and coordinating releases.

### Additional Supporting Roles:
- **Community Moderators**: Help manage discussions, ensure a positive environment, and assist new contributors.  
- **Documentation Maintainers**: Improve and update project documentation.  
- **Testers/QA**: Ensure proper testing and validation before releases.

## 3. Issue & PR Handling
- **Merge rights**: A **core maintainer** or at least **two** other approved members must approve before merging.  
- **Release management**: A **core maintainer** or **release manager** must oversee releases.  
- **PR approvals**:  
  - Requires a **core maintainer** or at least **two** other members.  
  - Feature/major changes must use a **feature branch workflow**.  

## 4. Conflict Resolution
Conflicts will be resolved through **maintainer discussion**. If a resolution cannot be reached internally, the decision may be put to a community vote.
